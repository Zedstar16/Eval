# Eval
Pretty simple plugin as always :D

This plugin gives a /eval command

SAFE for use on production server!

/eval is used to execute php code in game, the plugin catches all errors, and sends the error message to you.

If you try executing php code that crashes you, please create an issue so i can add the necessary catch :D

By default this command is only available to OPs, however you can edit the config so a password is required to run the command.

You can use most predefined variables in this command such as $this->getServer() or whatever and $sender (You)
